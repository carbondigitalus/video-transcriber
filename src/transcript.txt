Even Jared talking about the weird database bullshit that he does that I can't fucking comprehend, that's actually entertaining. If Jared just set up a like a live or now behind over his shoulder while he's like programming and like going through his database, it would actually be pretty cool. It's like, hey, these are the features of the database. And if Jira Here's a fucking idea, right? I'm getting my own label. If Jared set up alive and it was just over his shoulder, and he's like, Hey, guys, Jared ledbetter. I'm just talking about the new veteran's database. They created. Here's some features I incorporate, and this is why I put them in here. And if he just did three minutes, short form content, popped it on and then tagged like ten veterans, he'd have sign ups. And then once what you can do, if you want it really short, like a minute, and there's a reason for this, Average video should be three minutes. Shortform is less than a minute because on TikTok, you can add music to it and you could upload it as a YouTube short. Which gets a lot more engagement. So if Jared were to create a series of videos explaining Veterans database, I feel like that's a big disconnect because Jared's done a lot of work for it, but people don't the reason they're not flocking to to you Jared is because the messaging isn't super clear about what it is. It's a veteran's database, yes, you can connect. Yes, you can, you know, meet up with people in different industries. And that's awesome. The messaging needs to be a lot more clear. And this is when we're going back to strategy of what makes something popular or what makes people come on board. We have to talk about the problem that it solves, and we have to talk about proof of concept, and then sometimes we have to talk about hard details. So right off the bat, Jared, you don't have to answer this in comments, and I'm not calling you out or anything. I'm just more suggesting things that I see as a non techie, which you should be listening to because I am your audience. Veteran business owner, right, non techy, not super sophisticated. You should have a little bit of content about the hard numbers. Like, hey, this is the cost. This is what you're gonna get. This is what it entails. Just the FAQs. FAQs are really good. When you have a concept that's that's being brought out to market. So you can do one on FAQs. You can do one on a video just talking about, hey, business owners. If you're a veteran, this is why you need to check out the database. You're gonna be able to do this, this, this. Okay. You have to set people up with desire. With attraction. And what I mean by that is what makes it beneficial to them? Why should they give a shit? Right? So when I'm talking about my own service Like, Jared has something tangible that he can fucking share with people and show them visually, right, for PR services. I have to isolate what the problem I solve is. So the point is, Jared, I'm out here telling the why. This is what happens when you sign on with veteran database. This is what you're gonna get out of it. This is proof of concept. You know, hey, this guy signed up for it. This is how he's using it. You have to it's okay, man. I I'm a get slow internet messages. So just bear with me guys if if it's, like, coming in and out. Sorry. Nothing I can do about you have to be able to explain the benefits. And then if you peel back and you're making videos about whatever it is that you wanna sell or get people to do, it's an easier sell.
